Hi there 👋
We're building Poland.gg — a lightning-fast statistics platform that makes Polish data instantly accessible to everyone.
🙋‍♀️ What we do
We take official government data from GUS (Statistics Poland) and present it in a clean, instant-loading interface. No university degree required to understand it, no waiting for pages to load.

📊 Population, housing, and geographic stats
🗺️ Interactive maps from country → voivodeship → powiat → gmina
🌍 Available in English and Polish

🌈 Contributing
We're early stage and not open source yet, but we'd love feedback! Open an issue if you:

Found a bug or incorrect data
Have a feature request
Want to suggest a new dataset

🍿 Fun fact
This project started because the founder needed Polish disability statistics for a non-profit — and got different numbers from ChatGPT every time he asked.
